# Medical Basics

<!-- FIXME: citation numbering (markdown-it core chain) -->

In the description of [goals and tasks of rehabilitation technology](chapter4.html#goals-of-rehabilitation-technology), it was made clear that the main difference between medical technology and rehabilitation technology is that technical aids do not (cannot) aim at healing and rehabilitation technology, therefore, does not start with the disease or impairment but only with the disability and the handicap (<<fig:medical-technology-rehabilitation-technology>>, [@zagler:2008]).

![Medical technology and rehabilitation technology in relation to the chain of effects from disease to handicap.](./pics/06/medizintechnik-rehabilitationstechnik-wirkungskette.svg "medical-technology-rehabilitation-technology#Medical technology and rehabilitation technology in relation to the chain of effects from disease to handicap [@zagler:2008].")

However, the <<fig:medical-technology-rehabilitation-technology>> diagram also shows that every disability has a “medical history” in some way.
Thus, it is important for the technician to also be able to read and understand the medical history when selecting technical measures.
Therefore, this chapter discusses the basic medical (anatomical and physiological) principles most important to understanding rehabilitation technology, especially those related to the nervous system, sensory organs, and musculoskeletal system[^4].
In addition, the appendix contains a glossary of basic medical terms and the terms used to describe damage that leads to impairments and handicaps.

[^4]: Some parts of this chapter were taken with minor changes from the diploma thesis of Angela Zagler: “Menschliche visuelle Wahrnehmung und ihre maschinelle Substitution für sehbehinderte Menschen” [@zagler:1997].
