# Major Types of Disability

## Causes of Disability

Conditions causing disability can be classified as follows [@koutoukidis:2008]:

- Inherited: genetically transmitted
- Congenital: conditions resulting from infection during the mother's pregnancy, or injury during or soon after birth (e.g. cerebral palsy)
- Acquired: resulting from accident, intentional injury, substance misuse, or illness during life (e.g. amputation due to injury in a car accident or due to effects of diabetes)
- Of unknown origin

Depending on the concrete physiological or mental effect of a disability, the following major forms can be classified:

- Physical Disability
- Sensory Disability
- Mental Disability

## Physical Disability

Physical disability involves several serious, mostly lifelong disabilities, which restrict the person in particular in his/her motor abilities.
The most common manifestations are:

- Damage to the central nervous system
  - Paraplegia
  - Central motoric movement disorder as a result of accidents or insults
  - Multiple sclerosis
  - Spina bifida
  - Parkinson’s disease
  - Cerebral Palsy
- Damage to the skeletal system
  - Deformation of the spine (scoliosis, lordosis, kyphosis)
  - Osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease)
  - Joint malformations (luxation)
  - Malformation of the skeletal system
    - Dysmelia (disorders of extremities development)
    - Cleft formation of hand or foot (e.g. clubfoot)
- Amputations
- Muscle disorders (muscular atrophy, muscular dystrophy)
- Inflammatory conditions of bones and joints (arthritis)

A physical disability is not a static situation.
It can be, as mentioned before, inherited but also acquired through accidents or diseases.
Through medical treatment or medical aids and appliances, the disability can be cured or moderated.
Thus, disability is always a complex process of causes and consequences, direct effects, individual destinies, and social consequences [@fürstler:2000].
In the following, two common forms of physical disabilities will be introduced in more detail: paraplegia/spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy:

### Paraplegia and Spinal Cord Injury

Depending on the paralyzed regions of the patient several terms are common.
Paraplegia is used if the lower extremities or the trunk are paralyzed (motor or sensory loss).
Tetraplegia describes the paralysis of all four extremities, while hemiplegia covers half of the body divided by the sagittal plane.
In the case of spinal cord injury (SCI), the clinical classification depends on several criteria like sensory/motor impairment, complete or incomplete SCI, the severity of the injury, and the level of spinal lesion.
The level of spinal lesion divides the spinal cord into an upper part, where motor and sensory functions are intact, and a lower part where this is not the case.
See Figure 29 for the four existing groups of levels, which are cervical (C2 - C8), thoracic (T1 - T12), lumbar (L1 - L5), and sacral (S1 - S5). [@keller:2002, pp. 34-37]

Figure 29: The groups of levels illustrated at the spinal cord, lateral view (left), and the regions of sensory skin nerves (right). Reprinted from [@popovic:2000]

The extent of functional loss of the upper extremity varies depending on the level of the lesion and includes loss of a finger, hand, arm, and shoulder functions.
Furthermore, motor and sensory functions can be impaired individually or in conjunction. [@keller:2002, pp. 34-37]

### Cerebral Palsy

Cerebral Palsy, short CP, is a lesion that occurs in the immature brain leaving children with permanent motor impairment (palsy).
It describes a group of disorders concerning the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation.
The motor disorders of CP may come with disturbances of sensation, cognition, communication, perception, behavior, or seizure disorder, respectively.
The causative event of CP occurs in early childhood, which is defined as less than 2 years of age.
The reasons for the lesion can be a developmental defect (e.g. lissencephaly), infarction (e.g. middle cerebral artery occlusion in a neonate), or trauma during or after delivery.
As CP is a persistent but not unchangeable disorder of motion and posture, it is somehow a stable and definite situation.
Nevertheless, “not unchangeable” means that motor and non-motor disorders provoked by CP can improve or worsen, spontaneously by themselves or through treatment.
These changes are due to the plasticity of the CNS, its compensatory capabilities, and the possibility to learn through experience. [@ferrari:2010] [@miller:2005]

The main classifications of CP are based on

- Muscle tone anomalies like hypertonia or dystonia,
- The type of the prevailing neurological symptom like ataxia, choreoathetosis and
- Its somatic location, e.g. diplegia, tetraplegia, hemiplegia. [@cioni:2010]

To get an idea of the clinical syndromes of CP, the following there is an extract from [@cioni:2010] – Traditional Clinical Syndromes like spastic tetraparesis, spastic diplegia, spastic hemiplegia, ataxic form, dystonic from and athetosic (or choreo-athetosic) form of CP.

#### Spastic Tetraparesis

In tetraparesis, tone and motion disorders are usually severe, rarely symmetrical, “equally” involving upper and lower limbs and generally becoming apparent from birth.
Posture motor development is severely delayed; the prognosis for autonomous walking and manipulation is adverse.
Visual disorders (visual agnosia, gaze palsy, strabismus, reduction of visual acuity, etc) and hearing disorders are frequent.
Epilepsy is very often present, usually in a secondary generalized form (infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, etc).
Mental failure is often associated, consequent both the cortical neuropathological damage and early motor disorder, impairing the acquisition of the fundamental stages of physical development.
Consequent to spasticity, patients suffer from widespread muscle contractures and articular and skeletal position deformities.
The most frequent anatomical lesions, also detectable in vivo through neuroimages and especially through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are represented by diffuse periventricular leukomalacia or by multicystic damage with severe cerebral atrophy.

#### Spastic Diplegia

In spastic diplegia, tone and motion disorders involve all four limbs, with more severe involvement of the lower limbs.
This is the typical clinical picture of severe pre-term children, with a high incidence of periventricular leukomalacia.
The type of motor damage is caused by the proximity of the malacic lesions to the course of the corticospinal pathways to the lower part of the body.
Hypertonia, mostly involving sural triceps and hip adductors, rarely becomes apparent before the third-fourth month after birth, and sometimes even later.
Traditionally (but this term is no longer accepted, see chapter 3), the clinical history includes a “silent period” taking place after the acute stage of the cerebral damage and before tone disorders and motor development retardation become evident.
Upper limb motricity is quite preserved; the prognosis for walking, even without walking supports, is usually favorable.
Cranial nerve involvement is frequent, as well as strabismus.
Intelligence and speech development are usually not impaired.
Epilepsy is rare.
Muscle contractures and articular deformities of the lower limbs are frequent.

#### Spastic Hemiplegia

<!-- FIXME: check "praxic" -->
<!-- FIXME: check "trophism" -->

Muscle tone and voluntary motion disorders only affect one body side.
Involvement can be more marked in the upper or the lower limb, often mainly distal but sometimes also proximal.
The prognosis for autonomous walking is almost always favorable.
Patients often present with convulsion discharges, and expressions of partial epilepsy.
Alterations of the body pattern and the praxic and gnostic organization are frequent.
The development of intelligence can be impaired; when the paretic side corresponds to the dominant hemisphere, retardation in speech development may be apparent.
Muscle contractures and articular deformities usually develop on the paretic side, even at an early stage; muscle and bone trophism is usually reduced.
The anatomical and neuroradiological correlate is mostly represented by isolated porencephalic cysts, lesions of the internal capsule, or even periventricular lesions, also bilateral, or by more diffuse damage of a cerebral hemisphere.

#### Ataxic Form

It is by far the rarest form of CP.
Motion coordination disorders (tremors, dissymmetry, adiadochokinesia, etc) and balance disorders (ataxia) prevail.
In the first months of life, it is characterized by the presence of a marked hypotonia, usually persisting even later in life; psychomotor development is usually delayed; often a cerebellar ocular nystagmus is present.
Sometimes, it can be associated with symptoms of pyramidal origin.
Speech is characterized by delayed development, sometimes even severe, and words are scanned.
Mental deficiency is often present.
From the anatomical point of view, these forms are associated with cerebellar damage and/or damage to cerebellar downstream pathways, usually due to malformative alterations, with structural growth defects, or with infectious diseases.
Seldom it may derive from perinatal hypoxic-ischemic haemorrhagic damage.

#### Dystonic Form

Motor disorders result from an extrapyramidal system dysfunction, followed by a tone regulation alteration.
Underlying muscular tone is reduced in rest conditions, while in conditions of stimulation and motor constraint it consistently increases, leading to postures that are fully overlapping to those observed in spastic syndromes.
Rapid and non-coordinated involuntary hyperkinetic syndromes are constantly present, especially in the face and mouth.
Pyramidal type clinical signs are sometimes associated (mixed forms).
The continuous variability of tone also impacts mouth- speech muscles, resulting in an impaired voice emission, with very fast and often incomprehensible speech.
Cognitive development is seldom impaired.
At the encephalic level, the lesion is thought to be in the basal nuclei; when severe, it can be identified as the so-called “status marmoratus”.
Once mostly associated with neonatal jaundice due to mother-foetus incompatibility, this form of CP mostly represents the outcome of a severe perinatal asphyxia in term infants.

#### Athetotic (or Chore athetotic) Form

<!-- FIXME: quotation mark -->

Also in this form, symptoms are consequent of extrapyramidal system dysfunction, with the prevalent location in the caudate and putamen.
The clinical picture is characterized by hypotonia and by the presence of slow, arrhythmic, and continuous polypoidal movements, usually occurring from the first months after birth, and often by rapid, proximal, choric movements involving the face, the tongue, and the distal part of the limbs.
Pyramidal symptoms may coexist.
Usually, the development of intelligence is not strongly impaired, and speech is dysarthric.
When it is caused by hyperbilirubinemia, it is often associated with perceptive deafness.“ [@cioni:2010]

However, children with CP are in most ways normal children with special needs.
The greater long-term goal is for children with CP as for any other children, to grow and develop to their maximum capabilities in a way that they may succeed as contributing members of society. [@ferrari:2010]

## Sensory Disability

Sensory disabilities can involve one or more of the senses, although the term is primarily used to refer to vision and hearing impairment

- Vision impairment
- Hearing impairment
- Olfactory and gustatory impairment
- Somatosensory impairment (impairment of the tactile sense)
- Balance disorder (impairment of the vestibular system)

In the following, major forms of visual and hearing impairments are outlined in more detail.

### Visual Impairments

About 135 million people worldwide have a visual impairment or are blind – and millions experience visual disabilities when they age. [@robitaille:2010]
The types of visual disabilities are manifold – they include

- Refractive errors (Myopia - near-sightedness, Hyperopia – farsightedness, Presbyopia)
- Glaucoma (damage to the optic nerve caused by high intraocular pressure)
- Cataract (opacity/haze of the lens, can be caused by diabetes, infectious diseases, age)
- Retinopathic pigmentosa (degeneration of the visual rods, hereditary or caused by infection)
- Hemianopia (half sided vision loss caused by tumors, traumatic brain injury, or stroke)
- Damages to the neural system, optic nerve, or retina lead to blindness. [@zagler:2012]

### Hearing Impairments

Hearing impairments can have various physiological and anatomical reasons, ranging from mechanical defects in the outer or middle ear regions (eardrum, malleus, incus and stapes, oval and round window) to problems in the inner ear (cochlea) or defects in the electric propagation of auditory stimuli via nerve cells in the basal regions of the brain. [@zagler:2012]

Tinnitus is the perception of sound within the human ear in the absence of corresponding external sound.
It can be classified into subjective tinnitus (why no obvious physical reason) and objective tinnitus (where noise production is cause by a problem in the inner ear).
Only a tiny fraction of all tinnitus cases are objective ones.
Hearing impairments are usually diagnosed using an audiometric hearing test.
Using the pure tone audiometry, testing thresholds of audibility are established and can be compared with a normal (physiological) hearing capacity. [@zagler:2012]

Figure 31: Audiometric measurement device, normal hearing threshold curves for air conduction (x) and bone conduction (]) [@zagler:2012]

Depending on the level of hearing loss, the ICIDH classifies following stage of hearing impairment: mild hearing loss (26-40 dB attenuation), moderate hearing loss (41-55 dB), moderately severe hearing loss (56-70dB) severe hearing loss (71-91 dB), profound hearing loss (>91 dB) and deafness. [@zagler:2012]
The kind of hearing impairment can often be diagnosed from the differently shaped curves for air- and bone conduction levels:

Figure 32: Different kinds of hearing loss: conductive (top, left); sensorineural (top, right); noise induced (bottom, left); age-related: Presbycusia (bottom, right) [@zagler:2012]

## Mental Disability

- Intellectual disability: Intellectual disabilities are characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical skills.
  These disabilities originate before the age of 18. [@american-association-on-intellectual-and-development-disabilities:2013]
  Impairments to the brain (body function) result in activity limitations and participation restrictions.
  Brain impairments associated with intellectual disability result in limitations in intellectual function. [@wehmeyer:2010]
- Mental illness
- Development disability

In the following, Trisomy 21/Down Syndrome will be explained in more detail, as this is a common cause of intellectual disabilities.

### Trisomy 21 – “Down Syndrome”

Trisomy 21 (also known as “Down syndrome”) is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities in humans, occurring in about one per 1000 babies born each year.
The genetic cause of Down syndrome - an extra copy of chromosome 21 - was identified by French researchers in 1959.
It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual disability. [@weijerman:2010] [@hickey:2012]

Figure 33: Karyotype for trisomy Down syndrome: Notice the three copies of chromosome 21 [@human-genome-project:2013]

In Down syndrome, physical and mental development is typically delayed.
Infants tend to be placid and passive and do not cry as often as expected.
The intelligence quotient (IQ) among children with Down syndrome varies but averages about 50, compared with normal children, whose average IQ is 100. [@weijerman:2010]

Children with Down syndrome have better visual-motor skills (such as drawing) than skills that require listening.
Thus, their language skills typically develop slowly.
Behavior suggestive of attention-deficit disorder (sometimes with hyperactivity) is often seen in childhood.
Children with Down syndrome are at greater risk of autistic behavior, especially those with severe intellectual disabilities.
Depression is also common among adults and may also occur in children.
Early intervention with educational and other services improves the functioning of young children with Down syndrome. [@down-syndrome-education:2015]

Children with Down syndrome often have heart defects.
They have hearing loss and are prone to recurring ear infections.
They are also prone to vision problems because of problems in their corneas and lenses.
The joints in the neck may be unstable, which can lead to weakness or paralysis.
Many people with Down syndrome develop thyroid disease (such as hypothyroidism) and diabetes.
They are also at a higher risk of developing infections and leukemia.

Assistive Technology devices applicate to help kids/people with Down syndrome include computers with touch screens and a communication boards with symbols or letters (see chapter 8 Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)), adapted objects and tools for easier handling (for example a spoon with a special handle), leg braces or walkers which help the person to walk.
