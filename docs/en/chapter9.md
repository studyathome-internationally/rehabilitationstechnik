# Assistive Technology - Basics

In the Assistive Technology Act of 2004 from USA Public Law [@assistive-technology-act:2004], the term “Assistive Technology”
is defined as “technology designed to be utilized in an assistive device or assistive service”:

- An Assistive Technology device is “…any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.”
- Assistive technology service means any service that directly assists an individual with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device.

This means that the term Assistive Technology (AT) includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative technologies and devices as well as the process used in selecting, locating and using them.
Thus, AT products help people with disabilities in performing daily living tasks, communication, education, or work.
They give these people alternative access to advanced electronic devices like computers or mobile phones and help them to achieve greater independence and improve their quality of life.
It enables people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish or had great difficulties with accomplishing what means greater independence. [@asterics:deliverable:2.4, @soprano:deliverable:1.1.2]

## Goals and Target Group

The target groups for the application of Assistive Technologies are persons with physical or mental challenges or social handicaps.
Thus, goals of Assistive Technologies are to overcome completely or partly those functional or social restrictions and/or to compensate effects of diseases and disabilities without necessarily changing the underlying causes themselves, thus creating a barrier-free environment.

Figure 34: A personal assistive tool to restoring a function (a), communal assistive technology to overcome a barrier (b) and a barrier-free design to remove or avoid possible barriers (c).

1. Goal of Assistive Technology – Personal Approach
   The first goal is to restore or improve an impaired function.
   This approach applies with incapacities/skill deficits.
   With an assistive device the functional restriction (disability) is compensated (producing activity), for example by a hearing aid.
   This concept is represented in Figure 34 a), where the “H” stands for the helping tool.
2. Goal of Assistive Technology – Communal Approach
   With this approach the effects of impairment are overcome without any restoration or improvement of the function itself.
   This approach applies to the handicap.
   The functional restriction remains, but the person is again able to fulfil his or her role in society (producing participation).
   This approach is depicted in Figure 34 b).
3. Goal of Assistive Technology – Design Approach
   The third goal of Assistive Technology is to remove barriers or to avoid them from the start.
   It applies to the design of the built environment by creating barrier-free environments, whereby barriers are to be seen in the broadest sense.
   This concept is represented in Figure 34 c).

## Assistive Tools: A Matter of Design

To reach the already mentioned third goal of Assistive Technology barriers are removed by the right design.
Thus, this approach will be described more in detail, and principles of Universal Design are presented.

### Narrowing the Gap

As mentioned before in chapter 1.2 Disability as Difference between Personal Ability and Societal Demands the Gap Theory says that disability is the difference between the personal abilities and the demands which are posed to this person by society or environment.
There are two directions to close the gap between abilities and demands – first, to increase the personal abilities, or second to decrease the demands of a product or the environment.

Figure 35: Narrowing the gap between personal abilities and demands either through increasing the abilities with assistive tools or through decreasing demands with the help of (universal) design [@zagler:2013].

In recent years, a few design philosophies have developed:

- Barrier-free Design
- Adaptable Design
- Design-for-All
- Universal Design

Even if each philosophy has its definition and its approach, they all have one goal – to narrow the gap between the demands from the environment and the abilities of a person by reducing the demands.
Nevertheless, the term “Universal Design” has become the most preferable.

### Principles of Universal Design

Pioneers in the topic “Universal Design” is the “Center for Universal Design” at the North Carolina State University where the seven principles of Universal Design were developed [@zagler:2013], which are

1. Principle: Equitable Use  
   The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities
2. Principle: Flexibility in Use  
   The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities
3. Principle: Simple and Intuitive Use  
   The use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge,
   language skills, or current concentration level.
4. Principle: Perceptible Information  
   The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of
   ambient conditions of the user’s sensory abilities.
5. Principle: Tolerance for Error  
   The design minimizes hazards and adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
6. Principle: Low Physical Effort  
   The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.
7. Principle: Size and Space for Approach and Use  
   Appropriate size and space are provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of the user’s body size, posture, or mobility. [@connell:1997]

## Classification of Technical Aids

### Augmentative Aids

With an augmentative aid, a stimulus or an action is amplified in such a way that it becomes effective also for an organ with reduced functionality or capability.
This amplification is represented in Figure 36 as a thickened arrow.
Examples of augmentative aids are glasses, orthoses, hearing aids, or walking aids. [@zagler:2013]

Figure 36: Principle of an augmentative aid: the input or stimulus (left picture, left arrow) is amplified through a helping tool (“H”, right picture) [@zagler:2013].

### Substituting Aids

Substituting aid means that a stimulus is redirected to another sensory organ that is normally not used for that purpose.
The same applies if an action or an activity is executed by another motor organ than usual.
With action or activity, a movement or the trigger for a movement is meant.
In that way there is a substitution, what is called “Vikariat” in German or simply “substitute” in English.
The principle of a substitute is represented in Figure 37, left where a person with visual impairment cannot perceive the stimuli (arrow) due to his/her impairment.
These optical stimuli can be converted by an assistive tool (“H” – helping tool) into an acoustic stimulus which is then redirected to the person's organ of hearing (Figure 37, middle).
Similarly, the optical stimuli can be converted into tactile stimuli, which are perceptible by the person (Figure 37, right).
Two very common examples are first Braille where the person “read” with his/her fingertips instead of reading with the eyes and second lip-reading where the eyes take over the task of the hearing sense. [@zagler:2013]

Figure 37: Principle of substituting aids: the stimulus (arrow, left) is converted and redirected to other sensory organs, e.g. converted into acoustic stimuli and redirected to the hearing sense (middle) or converted into tactile stimuli and redirected to the tactile sense [@zagler:2013].

If one sensory organ takes over the task from another sensory organ this is called “sensory substitution”.
These substitutions are limited by the bandwidth of human senses, which are displayed in <<tab:bandwidth-human-organs>>.
Due to these bandwidths, one must expect limitations by using a substitute.

| Sensory Organ          | Bandwidth in bit/s |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Vision (Eye)           | 10^6 bit/s         |
| Hearing (Ear)          | 10^4 bit/s         |
| Tactile Sensing (Skin) | 10^2 bit/s         |
| Smelling (Nose)        | < 10^1 bit/s       |
| Tasting (Tongue)       | < 10^1 bit/s       |

.bandwidth-human-organs#Bandwidths of human senses [@zagler:2013]

If an action is performed through a deputy, e.g. a device or robot, it is called “motor substitution”.
The example displayed in Figure 38 shows a substitution for the action lifting which is done by a device.
If the lifting through the device is initiated by pressing a button, then “pressing the button” is the substitute for the motor function of the upper limbs. Otherwise, if the lifting through the device is initiated by voice control, then “speaking” is the substitute for the motor function of the upper limbs. [@zagler:2013]

Figure 38: Principle of a motor substitution: substation of lifting through pressing a button, or through voice control, modified from [@zagler:2013].

### Bridging Aids

The purpose of bridging aid is to replace or bridge an interrupted part of a (sensor or actuator) function chain.
Thus, the stimulus is fed back to the original neural pathway or organ after bridging.
The assistive tool bypasses the broken function chain through that nerve paths behind the broken part get stimulated in a way that the stimulus is similar to the original stimulus (Figure 39).
Examples of bridging aids are cochlea implants or retina implants. [@zagler:2013]

Figure 39: Principle of a bridging aid: the assistive device (“H” – helping tool) bridges the broken sensory channel in a way that the stimulus (arrow) is fed back to the original neural pathway [@zagler:2013].

## Differentiation to Ambient Assisted Living

Ambient Assisted Living (or Active Assisted Living), in short AAL, means extending the time people can live independently in their preferred environment by increasing their autonomy, self-confidence, and mobility.
It aims to monitor and care for, to support maintaining the health and functional capability of the elderly individuals.
Furthermore, it enhances security and shall prevent social isolation by supporting maintaining the multifunctional network around the individual.
In addition, the Concept of AAL is understood as supporting carers, families, and care organizations and as increasing the efficiency and productivity of resources used in the aging societies.
Thus, AAL addresses, in particular, the issues affecting an aging population and targets the need of an individual and their caretakers, whereby two groups of persons are considered: elderly people and people with disabilities. [@soprano:deliverable:1.1.2, @active-assistive-living:2015]

In contrast, assistive technologies enable persons regardless of age to perform a function that due to disability is difficult to perform.
Some disabilities are associated with aging but aging itself is not a disability.
Therefore, the relation of Ambient Assisted Living Technologies to Assistive Technologies (AT) is that AT is a part of AAL technologies. [@soprano:deliverable:1.1.2]

AAL is described more as philosophy than technology, nevertheless different technologies will be needed for AAL solutions.
Some examples of these technologies are as follows:

- Software and network technologies
- Sensors and actuators
- Human-machine interfaces
- Embedded systems
- Smart homes.

The products and services of these technologies enable persons to perform tasks or functions at a level similar to an earlier experience, leading to a lifestyle of independence. [@soprano:deliverable:1.1.2]
